Browserosaurus is now considered _Public Feature Complete_, however I'm always
open to ideas.

- [New apps/browsers](guide/supporting-a-browser-or-app.md)
- [Bugs](https://github.com/KavanShaban/browserosaurus/issues)
- [Feature requests](https://github.com/KavanShaban/browserosaurus/discussions/categories/ideas)
- [Help](https://github.com/KavanShaban/browserosaurus/discussions/categories/q-a)

If you request a new feature that I do not consider a good fit for the project,
please fork the project, that is what Open Source is all about. Make something
for your own personality, strip out the stuff you donâ€™t like, have fun with your
own brand. I once suggested the name Browseratops to someone who wanted to make
a Linux portâ€¦ they didnâ€™t, by the way, in case you fancied trying that too. Be
sure to tell me how you get on; I'm always interested to hear about new
projects.
